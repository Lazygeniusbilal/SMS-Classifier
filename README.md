📱 SMS Classifier

Welcome to the SMS Classifier project! This end-to-end project showcases a complete workflow for building a machine learning model to classify SMS messages. The main objective is to distinguish between spam and ham (non-spam) messages. Here's a breakdown of what this project entails:

📊 Data Analysis

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Performed in-depth analysis to understand the data distribution and uncover hidden patterns.

Data Cleaning: Removed duplicates, handled missing values, and ensured data quality for robust model performance.

🧹 Data Preprocessing

Tokenization: Split SMS messages into individual tokens (words) to prepare for further text processing.

Stemming: Applied stemming techniques to reduce words to their base or root form (e.g., "running" to "run").

Imbalance Handling: Addressed class imbalance to improve model performance using techniques like oversampling and undersampling.

🛠️ Feature Engineering

Vectorization: Converted text data into numerical format using methods like TF-IDF to create meaningful features for the model.

Feature Selection: Selected the most relevant features to enhance model accuracy and reduce complexity.

🚀 Model Building

Algorithm Selection: Experimented with various machine learning algorithms to identify the best performing model.

Model Training: Trained the model on the preprocessed data to learn patterns and relationships.

Hyperparameter Tuning: Fine-tuned model parameters to optimize performance and achieve higher accuracy.

📈 Model Evaluation

Evaluation Metrics: Used metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to assess model performance.

Confusion Matrix: Visualized the confusion matrix to understand the model's classification abilities in detail.

💡 Insights and Conclusions

Model Insights: Gained valuable insights from the model's predictions and identified areas for further improvement.

Project Summary: Summarized the entire workflow, highlighting key takeaways and potential next steps.
